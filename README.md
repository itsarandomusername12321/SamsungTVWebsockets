# Samsung_Smart_TV_Websockets
I spent a little bit of time to work on this just to turn off my dad's TV without grabbing the remote...
Made with Chatgpt again XD
# How it work
Only need to install websockets (`pip install websockets`)

You grab your TV's ip address then uhh put it inside the script and run it. Verify your connection then that's all
# For older SamsungTV
